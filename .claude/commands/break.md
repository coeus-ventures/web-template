# Break

Instructions: $ARGUMENTS

- Break the spec into issues. 
- Create one issue "Implement [page name] prototype" to implement the components of the page and create the page without any behaviors only a front-end prototype.
- Create one issue per behavior. 
- Each issue is just the title and a brief overview. We will use the /plan command later to turn each one in a full plan.
- Issues tend to follow this naminsg convention:
  - Implement [name of the behavior]
  - Implement prototype of [name of the page] 
  - Change [name of the behavior] to X
  - Fix [name of the bug] in [name of the behavior]
  - Change design of [name of the component/page] to X
- Create the issues in the folder docs/issues
