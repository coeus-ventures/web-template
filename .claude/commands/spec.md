# Spec

Instructions: $ARGUMENTS

- Create a spec for this project using @docs/templates/spec.md format. 
- Create a SPEC.md file in the root of the project.
- Try to build an MVP, only the most essential pages and behaviors. We will iterate later.
- Think about what is the core job to be done of this project and focus on it. 
- A Behavior is an action the user can take on a Page.
- A job story is a design tool, often used as an alternative to user stories, that focuses on the job a user is trying to accomplish rather than the user themselves. It emphasizes the context and situation surrounding the task, the motivation for the task, and the desired outcome.

```
When <situation>, I want to <motivations>, so I can <expected outcome>.
