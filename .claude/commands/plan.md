# Plan

Instructions: $ARGUMENTS

- Update the issue file in the instructions by following the @docs/templates/issue.md format. 

- Issues tend to follow this naming convention:
  - Implement [name of the behavior]
  - Change [name of the behavior] to X
  - Fix [name of the bug] in [name of the behavior]
  - Change design of [name of the component/page] to X
  - Implement design of [name of the component/page] 
- Think step by step and be strategic following the architecture.
- Only change the necessary files if the behavior or component already exist. 
- Make only the most important test cases. The test cases should take inspiration from the Examples provided in the Functional Specification when applicable, even on the unit tests. 
- Only Update the issue file, don't start implementing yet.
