/**
 * The preview's half of the postMessage bridge.
 *
 * A prototype runs in a cross-origin iframe inside the Epic workspace. Neither
 * side can read the other's location, so the two talk in messages: this
 * component says where the preview is, and answers the two questions the host
 * is allowed to ask.
 *
 * Mounted once in the root layout so it survives every route change.
 * **Do not delete it when rebuilding the app** — without it the workspace's
 * address bar goes blank and screen switching stops working, in a way that
 * looks like the host is broken.
 *
 * Inert outside an iframe, and inert inside one whose parent origin is not
 * recognised. A prototype opened directly in a browser tab has nobody to talk
 * to, and a wrong `targetOrigin` would post this frame's location to a stranger.
 *
 * **This is location and navigation, and nothing else.** The annotation
 * toolbar talks to the workspace on its own, from the bundle Epic serves —
 * because that bundle can be fixed by a deploy while this file stays frozen
 * inside a Docker image for months. Anything routed through here would have
 * pinned the whole feature to whichever template version a machine was built
 * from.
 *
 * `docs/references/preview-bridge.md` is the contract, written for whoever
 * implements the host side.

 * that meets a type it does not know ignores that one message; a parser that
 * meets a version it does not know throws away the envelope, location and all.
 * Snapshots outlive deployments in both directions, so a preview and a host
 * are routinely one change apart — and adding types keeps that harmless, while
 * bumping the version would make an old host go blind rather than merely deaf.
